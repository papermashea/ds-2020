# Week 4: RDS & SQL

## Assignment Notes 
I've always wanted to learn about SQL and this assignment made it really straightforward. I'm very interested in learning more about SQL and played around a little bit with the sqliteonline demo sets. Additionally, I found a very helpful resource on AWS shortcuts: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/keybindings-default-apple-osx.html#keybindings-default-apple-osx-tabs so that I can more quickly switch between tabs and panes in my Cloup9 environment.

***

## Setup

### Viewing and cleaning JSON
npm install esformatter + esformatter [file]

### RegEx cleaning with match
Capitals, etc removal

***

## Databases

### Creating a table
When I first ran the starter code, I encountered an error:

```(node:7231) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning``

This was bevause I wasn't updating my code to the correct Endpoint in my RDS console.

### Segmenting, Commenting and Duplicating
I also learned the hard way why Aaron recommended compiling the pages as 3 separate scripts - managing duplications in my code became tricky and I ended up having to comment identification throughout the page. I prefer to have the initial code in 1 script to see it all togeher, but would like to break out my work from each week into individual scripts for my final project.

## Assignment Output

### aalocations object database
I was able to create the database "aalocations" with the sample addresses for practice, and can see them all via console.log in the final script.

### Zone 3 object reconstruction

### Quesions
- Is there any way to see the DB in RDS?
- What are best practices for script file management?
- How do you set a hard cap on # of calls?
