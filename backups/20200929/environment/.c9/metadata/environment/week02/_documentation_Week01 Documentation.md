Please see below for my attempts pre- and post-class.\n\n##Pre-class attempts\n###Brute force###\nI was able to get the files with a brute force method i.e. copy and pasting each get method for all 10 webpages. This code is commented out but is fairly standard to the sample code.\n\n### Looping method###\nFor my loops, I attempted two methods: making an array with all the URLS, and trying to splice a URL with a looping number\n\n**URL Array**\nI was able to print every URL, but I wasn't sure how to then use that array in the request function.\n\n**Adding numbers**\nI was able to break up part of the string, but unsure of what to loop into it.\n\n##Post-class attempts##\n###Step 1: Looping URLS###\nMy first step was looping numbers through the URL structure as recommended with the forEach method: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach\nI was able to create an array of the numbers (01-10) and use forEach to generate an array of URLs with the numbers from my array. I think injecting into the string of the URL may not be best practice as per our conversations in class, howevever I was able to shorten the original array I had made (of every URL hard coded).\n\n###Step 2: Looping within a request###\nAdding URLs to a loop before my request proved rticky at first, though it ended up being the exact same setup as my original forEach loop once I remembered to extract a single url from urls for my request instead of request my entire array as one object.\n\n##Step 3: Looping document names###\nI ended up breaking apart my document title in order to inject the same array into the text file names again. I'm not sure if there is a tidier way to name the files, I was heistant to edit the file sync too much.\n\n##Step 4: Be patient!##\nI had to learn several times that AWS takes a second to execute the request and dump the data into a folder, hence there being several iterations.","undoManager":{"mark":-2,"position":1,"stack":[[{"start":{"row":0,"column":1},"end":{"row":0,"column":22},"action":"remove","lines":["Process Documentation"],"id":2},{"start":{"row":0,"column":1},"end":{"row":0,"column":2},"action":"insert","lines":["A"]},{"start":{"row":0,"column":2},"end":{"row":0,"column":3},"action":"insert","lines":["s"]},{"start":{"row":0,"column":3},"end":{"row":0,"column":4},"action":"insert","lines":["s"]},{"start":{"row":0,"column":4},"end":{"row":0,"column":5},"action":"insert","lines":["i"]},{"start":{"row":0,"column":5},"end":{"row":0,"column":6},"action":"insert","lines":["g"]},{"start":{"row":0,"column":6},"end":{"row":0,"column":7},"action":"insert","lines":["n"]},{"start":{"row":0,"column":7},"end":{"row":0,"column":8},"action":"insert","lines":["m"]},{"start":{"row":0,"column":8},"end":{"row":0,"column":9},"action":"insert","lines":["e"]},{"start":{"row":0,"column":9},"end":{"row":0,"column":10},"action":"insert","lines":["n"]},{"start":{"row":0,"column":10},"end":{"row":0,"column":11},"action":"insert","lines":["t"]}],[{"start":{"row":0,"column":11},"end":{"row":0,"column":12},"action":"insert","lines":[" "],"id":3},{"start":{"row":0,"column":12},"end":{"row":0,"column":13},"action":"insert","lines":["n"]},{"start":{"row":0,"column":13},"end":{"row":0,"column":14},"action":"insert","lines":["o"]},{"start":{"row":0,"column":14},"end":{"row":0,"column":15},"action":"insert","lines":["t"]},{"start":{"row":0,"column":15},"end":{"row":0,"column":16},"action":"insert","lines":["e"]},{"start":{"row":0,"column":16},"end":{"row":0,"column":17},"action":"insert","lines":["s"]}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":0,"scrollleft":454,"selection":{"start":{"row":1,"column":0},"end":{"row":1,"column":194},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":0},"timestamp":1600203443329}
